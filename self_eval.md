1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I took breaks along the way but in total i think it took an hour and a half. It was just over that.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I would like to work on naming conventions for directories, projects, variables. These are things im unfamiliar with in Ruby
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- what's going on with '''else if''' ? When I did that i seemed to need another 'end'. I went back and realized it's actually spelled elsif. but i want to know how ruby is reading the code to want another 'end'. I will go search on Google after this exercise.
